# Coursera: Algorithms

This repository contains my programming assignments for [Coursera/Princeton's Algorithms course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part1).

Assignments:
* Percolation: Write a program to estimate the value of the percolation threshold via Monte Carlo simulation. Used WeightedQuickUnion data structure to efficiently model system percolation.

* Queues: Write a generic data type for a deque and a randomized queue. The goal of this assignment is to implement elementary data structures using arrays and linked lists, and to introduce you to generics and iterators.
